Hi! My name is Michelle Namgoong, and I’m a first-year computer science major
from Marietta, GA. I’ve been at Georgia Tech for about two weeks now, and I
already love the campus and the city. I love exploring new places and hanging
out with my friends and family (including my two dogs). I chose to take the
online asynchronous version of CS 1331 because I wanted to work at my own pace
along with my other classes. I’m looking forward to a great semester!
